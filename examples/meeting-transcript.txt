## Meeting: Task Manager App Planning
**Date:** January 15, 2024
**Participants:** Alice (Product Manager), Bob (Tech Lead), Carol (Designer)

---

**Alice:** Alright team, let's plan out this task manager feature. What do we absolutely need for the first version?

**Bob:** First things first - we need a solid project structure. I'm thinking Node.js with Express since that's what we're most comfortable with.

**Alice:** Agreed. That's definitely priority one. What about the actual task functionality?

**Carol:** Users need to create tasks, obviously. And see all their tasks in a list. Pretty standard stuff.

**Bob:** Right. So we need a data model for tasks. I'm thinking id, title, description, status, and timestamps. Pretty standard stuff.

**Alice:** What statuses should we support?

**Carol:** Let's keep it simple - todo, in progress, and done. We can always add more later.

**Bob:** Sounds good. So we'll need endpoints for creating tasks, listing them, updating them...

**Alice:** And deleting. People need to clean up their lists.

**Bob:** Of course. Full CRUD operations.

**Alice:** Should we add user authentication now?

**Bob:** I'd vote no for this phase. That adds a lot of complexity. Let's get the core task management working first.

**Alice:** Good point. Let's defer that to phase two.

**Carol:** What about categories or tags for tasks?

**Alice:** Also phase two. Let's just get basic CRUD working first.

**Bob:** I'll need tests for all this. We should make that a requirement.

**Alice:** Absolutely. Tests are non-negotiable. Can't ship without them.

**Bob:** What about due dates and reminders?

**Alice:** Out of scope for now. Let's not overcomplicate things.

**Carol:** Makes sense. Simple is better for the first version.

**Alice:** So to summarize - we need project setup, data model, CRUD endpoints, and tests. No auth, no categories, no due dates. Sound right?

**Bob:** Perfect. I'd prioritize it as: project structure first, then data model, then the create and list endpoints since those are most important, then update and delete, and finally tests.

**Alice:** Great. What branch should we use?

**Bob:** Let's use `ralph/task-manager-api`.

**Alice:** Perfect. Let's do this!
