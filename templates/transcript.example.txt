Date: January 15, 2024
Participants: Alice (PM), Bob (Dev Lead), Carol (Designer)

Alice: Alright everyone, let's plan out this task manager feature. What do we need?

Bob: First things first, we need a solid project structure. Can't build on a shaky foundation.

Alice: Agreed. That's definitely priority one. What about the actual task functionality?

Carol: Users need to create tasks, obviously. And see all their tasks in a list.

Bob: Right. So we need a data model for tasks. I'm thinking id, title, description, status, timestamps. Pretty standard stuff.

Alice: What statuses should we support?

Carol: Let's keep it simple - todo, in progress, and done. We can always add more later.

Bob: Sounds good. So we'll need endpoints for creating tasks, listing them, updating them...

Alice: And deleting. People need to clean up their lists.

Bob: Of course. Should we add authentication now?

Alice: No, let's defer that. Keep the scope tight for this phase. We can add auth in phase two.

Carol: What about categories or tags?

Alice: Also phase two. Let's just get basic CRUD working first.

Bob: I'll need tests for all this. We should make that a requirement.

Alice: Absolutely. Tests are non-negotiable. Can't ship without them.

Bob: What about due dates and reminders?

Alice: Out of scope for now. Let's not overcomplicate things.

Carol: Makes sense. Simple is better for the first version.

Alice: So to summarize - we need project setup, data model, CRUD endpoints, and tests. No auth, no categories, no dates. Sound right?

Bob: Perfect. I'd prioritize it as: project structure first, then data model, then the create and list endpoints since those are most important, then update and delete, and finally tests.

Alice: Great. Let's do this. Bob, can you start on the technical design?

Bob: On it.
