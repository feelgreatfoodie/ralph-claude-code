# Task Manager - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

A simple task management API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. This serves as a foundation for a larger productivity application.

## Problem Statement

Users need a straightforward way to track their tasks and todos. Current solutions are either too complex or don't provide the API access needed for custom integrations.

## Goals

- Provide a clean REST API for task management
- Support basic CRUD operations
- Ensure data validation and error handling
- Create a foundation for future features

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- User authentication (will be added in a future phase)
- Task categories or tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Collaboration features

## User Stories

### US-001: Initialize project structure
**Priority:** 1 (Critical)

As a developer, I want a clean project structure so that I can build features on a solid foundation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Project has standard directory structure
- [ ] Package manager is initialized
- [ ] Basic configuration files are in place

**Technical Notes:**
Use industry-standard conventions for the chosen tech stack.

---

### US-002: Create task data model
**Priority:** 1 (Critical)

As a developer, I want a task data model so that I can store and retrieve tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Task has id, title, description, status, and createdAt fields
- [ ] Status can be 'todo', 'in-progress', or 'done'
- [ ] Model includes validation for required fields

---

### US-003: Add task creation endpoint
**Priority:** 2 (High)

As a user, I want to create new tasks so that I can track my work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] POST /tasks creates a new task
- [ ] Returns 201 with created task on success
- [ ] Returns 400 with validation errors on invalid input

**Technical Notes:**
Validate that title is not empty.

---

### US-004: Add task listing endpoint
**Priority:** 2 (High)

As a user, I want to see all my tasks so that I can review my workload.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] GET /tasks returns all tasks
- [ ] Tasks are sorted by createdAt descending
- [ ] Response includes total count

---

### US-005: Add task update endpoint
**Priority:** 2 (High)

As a user, I want to update tasks so that I can change their status or details.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] PUT /tasks/:id updates an existing task
- [ ] Returns 200 with updated task on success
- [ ] Returns 404 if task not found

---

### US-006: Add task deletion endpoint
**Priority:** 3 (Medium)

As a user, I want to delete tasks so that I can remove completed or irrelevant items.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] DELETE /tasks/:id removes a task
- [ ] Returns 204 on success
- [ ] Returns 404 if task not found

---

### US-007: Add basic test suite
**Priority:** 3 (Medium)

As a developer, I want tests so that I can verify the API works correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tests cover all CRUD operations
- [ ] Tests verify error handling
- [ ] All tests pass

**Technical Notes:**
Use appropriate testing framework for the tech stack.

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
Simple REST API with in-memory storage initially. Can be extended to use a database in the future.

### Dependencies
- Web framework appropriate for the chosen language
- Testing framework
- Validation library (if needed)

### Data Model
```
Task {
  id: string (UUID)
  title: string (required)
  description: string (optional)
  status: enum ['todo', 'in-progress', 'done']
  createdAt: datetime
  updatedAt: datetime
}
```

## Success Metrics

- All API endpoints return correct responses
- All tests pass
- Code follows best practices for the language/framework

## Open Questions

- Which tech stack should be used? (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Should we use an ORM or raw queries when adding database support?
